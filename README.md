The is a port of Pascal Frey's MEDIT software for mesh visualization.

This is a statically-linked (MEDIT+libmesh+freeglut) configuration of MEDIT for Windows.

Open the medit.sln file in Visual Studio 201x+ to build.

When launched, the mesh.exe application will prompt the user for a name of a .mesh file.
Alternatively, the .mesh file name may be specified on the command line.

Documentation (such as it is) for MEDIT may be found in the docs/ folder.
The examples/ folder contains sample .mesh files that can be visualized.

As far as I can tell, MEDIT is provided with a GNU LGPL license.
