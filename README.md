# A port of Pascal Frey's `MEDIT` software for mesh visualization.

This is a statically-linked (`medit+libmesh+freeglut`) configuration of `MEDIT`,
presently for Windows only.

Open the `medit.sln` file in Visual Studio 201x+ to build/explore.

When launched, the `mesh.exe` application will prompt the user for a name of a `.mesh` file.
Alternatively, the `.mesh` file name may be specified on the command line.

Documentation (such as it is) for `MEDIT` may be found in the `docs/` folder.
The `examples/` folder contains sample `.mesh` files that can be visualized.

As far as I can tell, `MEDIT` is provided with a GNU LGPL license.
